JavaScript `<canvas>` demo

## Description

A simple artifical life demo using Javascript with the `<canvas>` element. Cells move individually, in random order. The direction each cell moves to is determined by a simple set of rules and the adjacent cells. Only one cell can occupy a given space. Eventually cells stack up into temporary structures.
